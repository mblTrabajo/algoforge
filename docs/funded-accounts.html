        <h2>Funded Accounts with $ALFO Staking</h2>
        <p class="subtitle">Access trading capital by staking $ALFO tokens, hitting performance targets, and proving consistency using AlgoForge bots.</p>
        
        <p>AlgoForge introduces a new dimension of opportunity: Funded Accounts, seamlessly integrated with our algorithmic infrastructure and native token economy. This system empowers users not just to automate their trading, but to scale their profits without putting more capital at risk.</p>

        <h4>How it works</h4>
        <p>Each user can opt to enter a funding challenge directly from the AlgoForge app. By completing trading milestones with their chosen bots, users unlock fully funded virtual accounts — where they keep up to 95% of all profits generated.</p>

        <h4>Token-powered access</h4>
        <p>Instead of paying traditional evaluation fees in fiat or stablecoins, users will stake a portion of $ALFO tokens to access the challenge. The more $ALFO you hold or commit, the higher the account tier you can unlock:</p>

        <p>Once the target is achieved using bots, the account becomes funded — and users start earning real rewards in a profit-sharing model paid in $ALFO.</p>

        <h4>Risk-free, smart contract secured</h4>
        <p>All challenge conditions, profit tracking and payouts are handled via smart contracts on Solana. If conditions are breached, the staked tokens are partially burned or redistributed as rewards across the ecosystem — keeping the system clean, fair, and deflationary.</p>

        <h4>Real performance, real ranking</h4>
        <p>Users who pass funded challenges are ranked on a public leaderboard by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><img src="icon-check.png" alt="check" class="inline-icon">ROI achieved</li>
            <li><img src="icon-check.png" alt="check" class="inline-icon">Tokens earned</li>
            <li><img src="icon-check.png" alt="check" class="inline-icon">Bot combinations used</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Their funded journey becomes part of their AlgoForge profile — a reputation system tied to on-chain results.</p>
        <p class="final-statement">This opens the door for AlgoForge to not only become a platform of automation, but a launchpad for funded traders — backed by performance, governed by tokens, and secured by code.</p>
